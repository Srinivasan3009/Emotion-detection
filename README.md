# Emotion-detection
**Emotion Detection – Naan Mudhalvan Project**
This project was developed under the Naan Mudhalvan skill development program, focused on applying OpenCV in computer vision tasks. The goal is to detect human emotions from facial images using machine learning techniques.

**Introduction**
Emotion detection is a practical AI application that interprets facial expressions to identify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and neutrality. This system processes facial images, detects key features using OpenCV, and uses a trained machine learning model to classify the emotional state.

**Project Structure**
emotion.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook containing code for:
  Image loading and preprocessing
  Face detection using Haar Cascade
  Feature extraction and emotion classification

README.md – Project documentation with setup and usage instructions.

**Technologies Used**
Python – Core programming language
Google Colab – Cloud platform for running notebooks
OpenCV – Face detection and image processing
Scikit-learn – Machine learning model training
NumPy & Pandas – Data manipulation
Matplotlib – Data and result visualization

**How to Run**
Open the notebook in Google Colab.
Upload the required image files.
Run all cells in emotion.ipynb.
The model will detect faces and classify their emotions.

**Features**
Face detection from static images
Emotion prediction using a trained ML model
Visual output with emotion labels
Easy-to-use Colab interface

**Future Enhancements**
Train with a more diverse dataset for better accuracy
Add real-time webcam-based detection
Integrate into a web or mobile application
Experiment with deep learning models like CNNs

**License**
This project is intended for educational use under the Naan Mudhalvan initiative and is not for commercial deployment.
